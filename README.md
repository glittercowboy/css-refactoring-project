## Project Progress

### ✅ Step 1: Variables System (Completed)
We've created a comprehensive variables system that captures the design tokens used throughout the site:

- Created `_variables.scss` with color, typography, spacing, and layout values
- Documented the design system in `docs/design-system.md`
- Created an implementation guide showing before/after examples
- Added a sample button component to demonstrate variable usage
- Developed a conversion strategy for the entire project

**Files created:**
- `scss/_variables.scss` - Core variables file
- `scss/main.scss` - Main entry file (imports variables)
- `scss/components/_button.scss` - Sample component
- `docs/design-system.md` - Design system documentation
- `docs/implementation-guide.md` - How to use variables 
- `docs/conversion-strategy.md` - Overall project plan

### ✅ Step 2: Base Styles (Completed)
We've implemented foundational styles for HTML elements using our variables system:

- Created base styles for typography, links, lists, and other HTML elements
- Added accessibility enhancements for better usability
- Implemented responsive typography with media queries
- Maintained design consistency across all base elements

**Files created:**
- `scss/_base.scss` - Core HTML element styling
- `scss/_accessibility.scss` - Focus states and screen reader utils
- `scss/_responsive.scss` - Media queries for responsive typography
- `docs/base-styles.md` - Documentation for base styles

### ✅ Step 3: Layout Components (Completed)
We've implemented reusable layout structures that provide the framework for all pages:

- Created a flexible container system with responsive behavior
- Built a simple grid system using flexbox for layouts
- Developed unified section and block components for content areas
- Implemented header and footer components with responsive styles

**Files created:**
- `scss/_layout.scss` - Core layout components (container, grid, sections)
- `scss/layout/_header.scss` - Header component with navigation
- `scss/layout/_footer.scss` - Footer component with link lists
- `scss/layout/_index.scss` - Import file for layout components
- `docs/layout-components.md` - Documentation for layout system

### ✅ Step 4: UI Components (Completed)
We've implemented a comprehensive set of UI components using the variables system for consistency:

- Created a system of reusable components for interactive elements
- Implemented accessible form controls with validation states
- Built flexible card and feature components for content display
- Added notification and modal components for user feedback
- Ensured responsive behavior and touch-friendly interactions

**Files created:**
- `scss/components/_index.scss` - Component import manager
- `scss/components/_button.scss` - Button component with variants
- `scss/components/_card.scss` - Card component for content display
- `scss/components/_form.scss` - Form controls and validation
- `scss/components/_image.scss` - Image component with variants
- `scss/components/_feature.scss` - Feature blocks with images and text
- `scss/components/_modal.scss` - Modal dialog component
- `scss/components/_alert.scss` - Alert and notification system
- `docs/ui-components.md` - Documentation for all UI components

### ⬜ Step 5: Utility Classes
Implementation of utility classes for common styling patterns.

### ⬜ Step 6: Responsive Styles
Implementation of responsive styles using the breakpoint variables.

### ⬜ Step 7: Integration
Combining all partial files into a final CSS file.

## Project Structure

The refactoring process follows these steps:

1. Create a variables system (colors, typography, spacing)
2. Create base styles 
3. Implement layout components
4. Create reusable UI components
5. Add utility classes
6. Implement responsive styles
7. Combine into a main entry file

## Benefits

- **Reduced file size**: Eliminate repetition through variables and mixins
- **Improved maintainability**: Logical organization makes code easier to update
- **Better performance**: Smaller, more efficient CSS files
- **Easier collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components
- **Consistent design**: Design system ensures visual consistency

## Implementation

Each step of the refactoring process is documented in its own folder with before/after examples to demonstrate the improvements.

## Technologies

- SCSS (Sass)
- Modern CSS best practices
