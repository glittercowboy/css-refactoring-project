# CSS Refactoring Project

This project contains a step-by-step approach to refactoring a CSS codebase to improve maintainability, reduce redundancy, and create a more organized structure.

## Project Progress

### ✅ Step 1: Variables System (Completed)
We've created a comprehensive variables system that captures the design tokens used throughout the site:

- Created `_variables.scss` with color, typography, spacing, and layout values
- Documented the design system in `docs/design-system.md`
- Created an implementation guide showing before/after examples
- Added a sample button component to demonstrate variable usage
- Developed a conversion strategy for the entire project

**Files created:**
- `scss/_variables.scss` - Core variables file
- `scss/main.scss` - Main entry file (imports variables)
- `scss/components/_button.scss` - Sample component
- `docs/design-system.md` - Design system documentation
- `docs/implementation-guide.md` - How to use variables 
- `docs/conversion-strategy.md` - Overall project plan

### ⬜ Step 2: Base Styles
Implementation of base styles using the variables system.

### ⬜ Step 3: Layout Components
Implementation of layout components like grid system, containers, and sections.

### ⬜ Step 4: UI Components
Implementation of UI components like buttons, cards, forms, etc.

### ⬜ Step 5: Utility Classes
Implementation of utility classes for common styling patterns.

### ⬜ Step 6: Responsive Styles
Implementation of responsive styles using the breakpoint variables.

### ⬜ Step 7: Integration
Combining all partial files into a final CSS file.

## Project Structure

The refactoring process follows these steps:

1. Create a variables system (colors, typography, spacing)
2. Create base styles 
3. Implement layout components
4. Create reusable UI components
5. Add utility classes
6. Implement responsive styles
7. Combine into a main entry file

## Benefits

- **Reduced file size**: Eliminate repetition through variables and mixins
- **Improved maintainability**: Logical organization makes code easier to update
- **Better performance**: Smaller, more efficient CSS files
- **Easier collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components
- **Consistent design**: Design system ensures visual consistency

## Implementation

Each step of the refactoring process is documented in its own folder with before/after examples to demonstrate the improvements.

## Technologies

- SCSS (Sass)
- Modern CSS best practices
