# CSS Refactoring Project

This project contains a step-by-step approach to refactoring a CSS codebase to improve maintainability, reduce redundancy, and create a more organized structure.

## Project Structure

The refactoring process follows these steps:

1. Create a variables system (colors, typography, spacing)
2. Create base styles 
3. Implement layout components
4. Create reusable UI components
5. Add utility classes
6. Implement responsive styles
7. Combine into a main entry file

## Benefits

- **Reduced file size**: Eliminate repetition through variables and mixins
- **Improved maintainability**: Logical organization makes code easier to update
- **Better performance**: Smaller, more efficient CSS files
- **Easier collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components
- **Consistent design**: Design system ensures visual consistency

## Implementation

Each step of the refactoring process is documented in its own folder with before/after examples to demonstrate the improvements.

## Technologies

- SCSS (Sass)
- Modern CSS best practices
